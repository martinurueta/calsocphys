                            <h3>History</h3>
                            <p>The idea to start a California chapter of the American Physiological 
                                Society was hatched during a conversation between then Executive 
                                Director of the APS, Marty Frank, and myself, at a Council meeting 
                                sometime in 2015. From there, I began to discuss the idea further 
                                with my California colleagues to gauge the level of interest. 
                                Realizing that there was significant interest to pursue the idea, 
                                I identified a few colleagues and friends to assist in the endeavor 
                                of starting a chapter in the nation's most populous state!<br><br>Moving 
                                forward, the organizing committee consisted of Past-APS President, Kim 
                                Barrett (UC San Diego), Alicia McDonough (USC), Martha O'Donnell (UC Davis), 
                                and myself (UC Merced).<br><br>We submitted a letter of petition, on behalf 
                                of the physiologists in California, to then APS President Jane Reckelhoff 
                                on August 29, 2016 to grant us chapter status. Our petition was approved by 
                                the APS Council in November, 2016. After months of extensive email exchanges 
                                to more formally organize our efforts, we held an inaugural planning meeting 
                                at UC Davis on Friday, July 7, 2017. During this meeting we completed the 
                                state and federal forms required to establish ourselves as a non-profit 
                                organization. We also outlined a plan for moving forward with our initial 
                                Chapter meeting, with Los Angeles in fall 2018 serving as the agreed upon 
                                site and date. However, our efforts to organize in time for this initially 
                                proposed meeting fell short for a number of reasons. Nonetheless, the 
                                interim and inaugural organizing committee pressed on and following a brief, 
                                but productive meeting at EB 2018 in Orlando, FL, the committee identified 
                                a more robust plan to move the chapter forward! In spring, 2019, the 
                                committee identified and secured space at the University of Southern 
                                California for an inaugural CASP meeting on Saturday, November 16, 2019. 
                                The committee identified Declan McCole (UC Riverside) to chair the program 
                                committee for the inaugural meeting.<br><br>And as they say in the movies, 
                                the rest was history!<br>Rudy M. Ortiz, PhD<br>Interim President, CASP (2019)</p>
