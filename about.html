                                        The idea to start a California chapter of the American Physiological 
                                        Society was hatched during a conversation between then Executive 
                                        Director of the APS, Marty Frank, and myself, at a Council meeting. 
                                        From there, I began to discuss the idea further with my California 
                                        colleagues to gauge the level of interest. Realizing that there was 
                                        significant interest to pursue the idea, I identified a few colleagues 
                                        and friends to assist in the endeavor of starting a chapter in the 
                                        nation's most populous state!

                                        Held an inaugural planning meeting at UC Davis. During this meeting

                                        moving forward with our initial Chapter meeting, with Los Angeles in 
                                        fall 2018 serving as the agreed upon site and date. However, our

                                the APS Council in November, 2016. After months of extensive email exchanges 
                                to more formally organize our efforts, we held an inaugural planning meeting 
                                at UC Davis on Friday, July 7, 2017. During this meeting we completed the
